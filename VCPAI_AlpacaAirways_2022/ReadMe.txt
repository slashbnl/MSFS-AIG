IMPORTANT NOTE:

We would very much like to thank the Alpha-India Team for the effort put in to 
producing this phantastic tool.  Thanks guys!

Our goal is to provide accurate model matching for our VA "Alpaca Airways" when 
using ATC networks like VATSIM or IVAO. While AIG's focus is to populate 
Microsoft Flight Simulator with real world traffic throughout the world, this 
flightplan does not reflect real world operations:
 
In order to make the AIGAIM integration of our repaints work for model matching
purposes, we have put up a flightplan that uses two larger Central African airports 
(FZAA and HRYR), creating one return flight (= 2 legs) for each aircraft once a 
week - starting on Monday 00z00. If you are regular user of AIGs Traffic 
Controller, please understand that you will encounter Alpaca Airlines planes at 
these airports at the set times.

We are in no way affiliated with AIG.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

Flightplans can be installed with AIG's AI Manager, AIFP v3 or manually with
AIG Traffic Tools (AIGTT).

For fastest installation we recommend AIG's AI Manager using One-Click-Installer (OCI)
Available at: https://www.alpha-india.net/forums/index.php?topic=24614


Copy the flightplan.ZIP to your harddrive. Open the AIGTech - AI  Manager and click the 
"Install (local ZIP)" tab. Direct to and choose the downloaded FP. In the next window 
click "Install using OCI". The repaints and eventually missing models will download and 
install automatically.

After the installation is finished, go to the "Settings / AIGAIM/OCI" tab and click 
"Verify Setup". This will take a while and you will probably need to install missing 
repaints - not for VCP, though :)

After the whole process has finished, update your VMR with ModelMatchingMagic.

SPECIAL THANKS:

All the beta-testers at AIG. Without them we would not have been able to release 
this flightplan.
