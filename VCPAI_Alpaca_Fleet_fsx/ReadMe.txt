This repaint repository is specifically designed to be used for model matching purposes in MSFS2020 by integration into the Alpha India Group AI Manager (AIGAIM). It does not contain the models themselves, which should aready be present in your AIGAIM installation. The integration is done by installing the "VCPAI_AlpacaAirways_***" flightplan in AIGAIM, which will automatically download and install the Alpaca Airways repaints to the appropriate SimObjects/Airplanes folders using the OCI (One Click Installer). After successful installation, the Alpaca Airways fleet will be available for model matching in your online network client of choice, for example when creating a model matching rule set (.vmr) for vPilot with ModelMatchingMagic.

REQUIREMENT: AIG Tech AI Manager (AIGAIM) installation.

INSTALLATION:

1) Download the latest VCPAI_AlpacaAirways_*** flightplan.
2) Open your "AIGTech - AI Manager" (AIGAIM) and install the VCPAI_AlpacaAirways_*** flightplan using the "Install (Local ZIP)" Tab. In the process, choose the "Use OCI" command. The OCI will automatically download and install this folder.
3) (for VATSIM/vPilot users...) Use ModelMatchingMagic to create an updated .vmr file and make it available to vPilot.


KNOWN ISSUES:
All FAIB models:	No cabin lights, no nav lights (reflections are present), strange doubling of wifi antennae; probably due to the L (LIT) textures not extracting correctly
UTT models:		Same as the above, at nighttime cabin window area appears lit like in daylight 
TFS_A340-600:		No taxi, landing or logo lights

NOTES

These aircraft were designed specifically for use as an AI aircraft. As such, the primary design criteria were that they look good sitting at the gate, or as seen when landing from an aircraft waiting to take off.
